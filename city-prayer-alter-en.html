            <p>
                As we visited different nations, we also witnessed that the Lord is doing great and swift works in Asia,
                Europe and different parts of the world.  We long to see more of His deeds in Vancouver, this mother womb of the “gatherings”!
                We started City Prayer Altar by the confirmation of the fathers and Prophet Imeil’s words, in 2014.
                Although we already had monthly joint prayer meeting, the Lord increased our frequency to make it a weekly prayer gathering.
                The Lord also moved our hearts that it should start with pastors, just like Jesus is our King and He is now
                sitting at the right hand of God interceding for us as an intercessor. As Jesus is our example,
                we also called the pastors to stand at the position first. As the pastors stand in position,
                it would be like the anointing poured out on Aaron’s head, flowing down to his head and beard and whole body,
                and the praying anointing will flow to the churches we are pastoring.
            </p>
            <p>
                As this group of pastors longed for the presence of the Lord, we started our weekly prayer gathering,
                and then the Lord led us to have a 12-hour worship each month, later becomes monthly First Fruit Gathering.
                Toward the end of 2016, we responded to Pastor David Demian’s call on “Awakening the Dawn” prayer.
                Since then, pastors from the city take turns leading the 5 am daily morning prayer meeting. Starting from December 25th 2016,
                this prayer meeting has not ceased for a day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Around the same time at the end of 2016, the Lord also put a burden in our heart about this Vancouver Gathering.
                We started seeking the Lord daily, and our desire is to prepare for Him a dwelling place, not only in far away nations,
                but also in our very city and amongst our churches. Between the local churches and the nations,
                the Lord is raising up cities that are after His own heart.  Just like the early churches, the Lord worked city by city.
                He broke down the walls between the churches, and released deeper anointing of loving one another.
                We are not only a family that pray together, we are also a truly family that walk together.
                We pray that the Lord will do greater things in your city.  Beautiful things are bound to happen when we love and walk together!
            </p>
